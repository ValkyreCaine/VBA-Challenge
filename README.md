# VBA-Challenge
Hello! Welcome to my Module 2 Challenge covering VBA as part of the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp!

This project showcases my use of VBA to clean, sort, and track stock changes over the course of 1 year. It accurately captures and conveys the greatest increases and decreases of the sample stocks within the quarter, as well as the greatest volume increase in that time period. 


In short, at the beginning of the year, MSE had the highest perctentage increase at 47.01%, VNG had the lowest at -77.83%, and HK had the highest volume increase of that quarter. By the end of the sample year, MSE still had the highest increase at 66.35%, RKS with the lowest at -42.47%, and ZRXB had the hightest volume increase in that quarter! 

The entire project was made useing VBA and an excel workbook provided to me. 

This does not include the skills I have with Pivot Tables, VLookup, Hlookup, or other Excel Functions. 


Thank you!
