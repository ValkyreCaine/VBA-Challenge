# VBA-Challenge
Hello! Welcome to my Module 2 Challenge covering VBA!
I want to start off by saying, I am more knowledgable about Excel and it's functions than I am about VBA. I do believe that VBA is a good stepping stone into coding so I am greatful to have started with it.
Additionally, I found this to be incredibly challenging as I can do everything that is being asked indepenant of VBA. I struggled a lot with this one. 

My code is based off of the coursework we were given, in class instruction, and troubleshooting with the Xpert Learning assistance. 
All code is typed by me, but inspired by the class and others. 
Thank you!
